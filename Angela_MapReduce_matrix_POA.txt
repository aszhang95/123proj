MapReduce POA for project:
Function returns an np_array of tuples (id_of_the_entity, sentiment) given a comment
Aggregate on triplet of (user, list(proper_noun, sentiment score)) into a matrix 
	Row = user
	Column = column is the entity
	Field = sentiment score
	// sometimes people will talk about the same entity
scipy.sparse  // shrink the matrix
may need to make a dictionary matching id of a specific type to its actual value
create another matrix in which 
       user = row, 
	column = entity 
	field = num_occurrences
c.pickle to store the matrix once it’s been created (look into options to export matrices from 
numpy)
