"&gt; You can say the same for two socialists, conservatives or liberals. 

To the contrary. Socialism and liberalism now have long track records of success across the world. Also, there are many conservative nations. 

Say what you want about fundamentalists, communists, and radical-environmentalists - you can find small communities based on their principles.

If libertarian ideology was an attractive social structure, we should have seen such societies on a micro-scale by now.

&gt; Libertarian ideas are not new and have been around for as long as political ideas have been formalised - the republican Leveller faction in the English Civil War were essentially libertarian, as were many Whigs and classical liberals.

You *really* need to read a civics book one of these days.

&gt; Most libertarians are classical liberals who simply want to see a reduction in the power of the state and a restoration of individual liberty.

I am largely ignorant of the parties in England. But if these people were honestly serious about reducing govt power and increasing freedom, they should join the Green party.

"Sigh. It's unfortunate that you would so quickly resort to insults, but I'll press on regardless.

You complained that polling and elections are not accurate gauges of support for Paul and his ideas because the people haven't been exposed to them. Now you say that the people who haven't heard his message won't be convinced enough to sway the results of those polls and elections. Well, which is it? Either the people paying attention are representative of the opinions of the entire populace or they're not.

&gt; YES! Anyone who is running a viable national campaign should get coverage.

It's impossible to define what a ""viable national campaign"" is. Wherever you set that threshold, there will always be someone who would claim that it is unfair to democracy and they would have something of a point. Also, you might want to ask that question of your own candidate, because as far as I'm aware he would be opposed to exactly the sort of thing you're proposing.

&gt; A paragraph above, you had implied that there ought to be some kind of artificial cut-off point, even for candidates who end up in double-digits in primary caucus and election results, like Paul.

How odd. That seems more like what you just proposed. Isn't Fox's position that Paul isn't a nationally viable candidate? While I personally believe that Paul should be included in this particular debate, I don't believe you *can* set any specific threshold to determine if a candidate should be included.

&gt; to specifically denote the fact that he is ignored most of the time, not that he has been ignored always and forever.

That's utterly ridiculous. You might as well say that I routinely fast, in that *most of the time* I'm not eating.

Since you obviously didn't read my follow-up to my own response, I got the job I WAS temping for and am making a decent salary.  That means I am no longer a temp, and have a prospect of upward mobility in a company who's morals I admire.  This exposes your major flaw... you equate what you are with your job.

&gt;Should have studied politics, or business. These things affect the world - arts do not.

You are so ignorant it pains me.  While yes, politics and business do change the world in fundamental ways, can you deny the effect of our most inspired and talented artists? What would our society be without (in no particular order) Shakespeare, Picasso, Dali, Frost, Poe, Michelangelo, Frank Lloyd Wright, Kurosawa, Spielberg, Mozart, Monet, Sondheim, Beethoven, The Beatles, etc etc...  I don't know about you, but I don't want to live in a world without these artists.  They've had a much greater effect on my personal life than any politician or businessman.  Sure, John Pemberton got the world to drink Coke, but Leonardo Da Vinci got the world to marvel at the Mona Lisa.  Which do you think will have the most lasting effect on society?  How can you make a sweeping jusgement and say art has no effect on the world?  After all, art exists to influence our perceptions, and perception is everything.

I'm very happy in my job and my life right now, I'll thank you for not assuming you can diagnose my mental state from these posts... Successful?  Success is compromising sanity and happiness for a liveable wage?  Success is warping your values, serving a company you may well despise to ensure a little upward mobility?  No thank you.  I am very happy, and successful.  And I place those two items in order of importance.  Please, respond away, make snap judgements about my faults, they will fall on deaf ears.  I won't even give this thread my attention.  I hope you find happiness, no doubt you've already found ""success""

"The Iraq and Gulf wars are leaps and bounds ahead of any other conflict or deployment that has happened since Vietnam. You can't even begin to compare what the US has been doing under democratic presidents to those.

There have been many organizations which were created by many countries which turned out to be benfiticial to their sponsors and their nations. The US isn't the only influence involved with al Qaeda. I don't believe that Brzezinski's influence is solely responsible for what they have become. No one who is legally allowed to make a public statement about these things has sufficient information to make claims about things like this. Their actions and words are the only things we can go by. Just like any other tool, Al Qaeda was not originally created as a force to fight America.

Personally, the AIPAC stuff looks kind of forced upon everyone, and I've been watching all candidates intensely to see how they react. Obama seems to be wisely staying away from most conversation with regards to this, although the support does bother me. As far as the military strike talk goes, I know he said it, but the context under which it was stated is shady at best, and I would like to know more of what he thinks with regards to that type of action.

Smart and dangerous? Anyone with power is dangerous. I don't believe he is genocidal. I believe he has the current standards of life in the West in his best interest, and it might be at the expensive of others who are not from the West. And this I do not agree with. However, that is what will keep you in power. Blood on the country's hands? Regardless of what is done, there will be blood. I do believe that Brzezinski will do all he can to minimize American causalities. 

&gt; When someone says that Democracy is harmful (inimical) to imperialism..you don't find malevolence in that, when it's being said by an imperialist?

It's not malevolence. It's realism. What he is suggesting is that the optimal path for success is not possible without the commitment of those who realize it is optimal. ""Intellectual support"".

&gt; Brzezinski is no friend to America and if he has his full way we'll be at war with Russia (which is what he dreams of).

I see nothing which suggests that. At the very worst I would think he would like to see Russia at war with the rest of the world and America sitting by itself enjoying the riches of the world.

"&gt; if it was true, there would not have been any palestinians agreeing to it, but Fatah did

Arafat didn't. And hey, when you have your foot on somebodies neck, they tend to agree to whatever you say.

&gt; Under Oslo a vast majority of the settlements would have been destroyed

80% of the settlers would have remained. Getting rid of the smaller independent settlements and counting by number, rather that people, is disingenuous. By the way, the actual details of the ""generous offer"" were kept secret. Ha'aretz published leaked details [here](http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/934110.html) only a few months ago.

&gt; and the ""borders, airspace and water"" would be in control of the palestinians after the 5 year transitional period.

How could the Palestinians control their borders when they were surrounded by Israel and the Israeli security buffer? Do you have a credible cite for that claim?

&gt; The main reason it's unreasonable is that Hamas would not agree to it and they are an aggressor in this situation.

Hamas is simply negotiating from a position of strength, unlike Fatah, but like Israel. Don't you understand what a negotiating position is?

&gt; They also would not lay down their arms.

Hamas would get no popular support in a free Palestine if they were to attack Israel as it would jeapordise the nascent Palestinian state. Can you think things through?

&gt; In addition, The Golan Heights was used as a place for sniper fire of Israeli children prior to 1948

Hyperbole. Didn't you read the bit where Syria said it would normalise relations? Why are you bringing up the past?

&gt; and the UN has determined the Sheeba farms were Israeli.

Where that woman is standing is nowhere CLOSE to 2,000 F.  She is on the very outside of the building, while the fires that are burning are, in this picture, above her, and probably further inside the building.  Chances are she moved towards the air of the impact site to escape the heat of the fire.  And at roughly 1,000 feet up, do you know how strong the wind would be up there?  FAIL.

I see no pictures at all of this molten steel, and even if there were, I think it could be explained by the fact that the fires in the rubble of the WTC were very possibly able to reach the tempeture required to melt the steele.

"&gt;Because it was part of the same property. They claim it caught fire from WTC 1 &amp; 2 even though it was across the street and buildings right next to them were barely scratched.

The Bankers Trust south of the site was severely damaged and is being dismantled because it can't be saved, also the rest of the WTC complex aside from 1, 2 and 7 were completely gutted by fire.  I don't know that there's any reason to believe the damage was completely uniform in all directions.

Also the buildings ""right next to"" 7,  the NY Telephone to the west of 7 and 90 Church to the East, *were* in fact severely damaged and according to [Wired's Status of Damaged Buildings archive](http://wirednewyork.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-3640.html)as of 6/9/2003:

""Telco building is still undergoing repairs. Verizon said employees may return by the end of this year.""

and

""90 West St was sold after 9/11. New owners stated plans to renovate as a residential building""

Neither building was in use a year and a half after the disaster... I might speculate that since the other buildings in question here are older masonry buildings they might have stood up better to debris penetration than a glass curtain wall building like 7 but that's just speculation on my part based on some familiarity with the area.

&gt;A good reason is that there was a command post for FEMA and CIA. 

Why is this important? Nobody was killed, and if they wanted to destroy paperwork they could just have bought shredders.  I'll assume that those two agencies relocated far enough away so that phone and data communications weren't affected and carried on, business as usual.   They're in *my* building now and if you have a good reason It's of immediate concern to me.  

Did the CIA blow themselves up?  Did FEMA?  Who benefited?  Answer: nobody.

&gt;Another good one is for insurance purposes, as Silverstein doubled his money. 

How does having the CIA in the building have anything to do with insurance fraud?  You think that a real estate developer secretly wired his  own building?  Keep in mind the supposed demolition job was real spook stuff, major work conducted that nobody noticed.  Very resourceful for a real estate developer.

&gt;Realize that WTC was a government building until a month before 9-11 when it was purchased by Larry Silverstein. Because there were TWO attacks, Larry collected TWICE.

The WTC was owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, not a Federal operation.

&gt;He was also in that interview on PBS Frontline where he said something to the effect of ""I remember getting a call from the fire department commander, telling me that they were not sure they were gonna be able to contain the fire, and I said, 'We've had such terrible loss of life, maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it.' And they made that decision to pull and then we watched the building collapse.""

That seems reasonable to me, he wasn't giving instructions, he was informed of what FDNY was going to do.

&gt;He claims he meant ""pull your firefighters out"", although that's a very common term in demolition. The term in demolition, according to debunkers, means you'll pull it down with cables. However, despite the propaganda, a lot of people use the term ""pull"" in demolition to drop a building.

I don't believe the FDNY takes orders from real estate developers.  Further, ""pull it down with cables""??  That makes no sense; how big a cable would you need to pull down a 47 story building?  I think a citation is needed here, prior to 9/11/01.  

And I've never been able to find any reference to ""pull"" in relation to demolition work prior to 9/11/01,  can you provide a citation?

&gt;I could never know ""why"" exactly. It's just another instance of foul play. However, there was a lot to gain by the current administration if those buildings came down.

Again, what was the gain?  Destroying paperwork?  

The only gain, and I think we agree on this, is that the destruction of the WTC gave Bush &amp; Co. the excuse they wanted for their attacks on civil liberties, international treaties, the Constitution and advanced the cause of the fascist 'neocon' agenda.  And that could have been accomplished by manipulating the 19 young religious fanatics with none of the rest of the semi-logical and completely illogical crap being spewed by Alex Jones and his ilk.  

On the subject of Jones, please note that he's making a lot of money off this just like he did the Y2K thing so he's got to be suspect... and talk show hosts have long thrived from manufactured controversy... Limbaugh, for example?

&gt;edit: also to note, there is video of WTC7 coming down. There are no cables on the building, and you see a demo crimp; another words, you see the main column give before the rest.

I didn't see a demo crimp, sorry, the collapse has been explained.  And why did the super sophisticated sappers blow up wht building in such a way that it looked like it had been blown up?  With all that planning and sneaking around they didn't think to do a sloppy job so it looked like an accident?

"I am always amazed at statements such as this.  Your argument is flawed in that you think people are too stupid to change when faced with a challenge.

The participants in the market have a fundamental -- yet sometimes skewed -- understanding of risk.  The current ""crisis"" was created because everyone assume somebody else had the risk.  Now, we certainly know better.  The issue is that people's perceptions of the risks have changed, so their behavior must necessarily change.

Let's look at your supermarket example.  First of all, there are many products in the supermarket that one might consider ""luxuries"" -- prepared meals, for instance.  Prepared meals are taxed whereas unprepared goods are not, and prepared items are usually the first to lose demand in a falling market.  If the market owner is indeed borrowing to buy supplies instead of carrying cash on the books to ride things out, he will change his buying strategy to guarantee that the items he buys will sell.  He can even reduce his total required expenditures, thus reducing capital demands, while still having enough for everybody to buy and survive.  In this case, he has managed the risk.

Let's go even further and look at the farmer.  If we assume the farmer is buying seeds at risk (i.e. he buys and plants crops on borrowed money anticipating that people will buy) he can do one of two things: 1) plant only those crops he knows people will buy (reduced risk); or 2) require up-front payment from customers before even planting (shifted risk to customer).  In fact, the latter technique is very popular for organic farms since they are typically higher-cost in the first place.

You simply cannot make any statement about the real economy by changing one variable and holding everything else constant -- markets just don't work that way.

Despite what anyone is saying, the market is working just fine.  People are trying to evaluate risks and make adjustments accordingly.  The problem is that the government keeps changing the rules and gaming the risk so that people cannot make effective decisions.

I am one of those who do not want to see the bail-out.  The market is scary right now -- I've lost more than $50k at this point -- but I'm not rushing to pull my money out.  Why?  Since there has been no bail out, the dollar has gained in strength *despite the flight to gold*.  At the same time, the banks are taking huge write-downs causing deflation -- a necessary evil after a huge inflationary period.  By my mediocre calculations the housing market needs to lose $1.2 Trillion to get us back on to the normal curve for housing prices, and we're getting close to that.  Third, the market is horribly undervalued right now given that everybody is scared.  The true value of the DOW in my estimation is around 11,200, and I've already ridden that bitch down from near 14,000 so there really aren't and more actual losses in my mind.  Given a year or two, as long as the government doesn't interfere, the jitters will leave the market and we'll see some reasonable action.

"&gt;it is not the case that rich people pay 39 times more in taxes, adjusted for earnings, than the average citizen

I didn't think that was what I was implying.  Percentage wise the richest 1% pay LESS tax than those in the 60th percentile (not below the 50th though).  

I don't think the richest are getting the short end of the stick, however here is my scenario:  Two people live in a house, one who makes $1million/year and the other $2/year.  Each contractually place half of their income into a fund to run the household, for a total of $500,001.  Despite the fact that they each pay 50% of their income, one is most certainly subsidizing the other in the home (at least economically).  Then Michael Moore moves in and tells the person who contributed the $1 that the millionaire is a son of a bitch low life and implies that he should fight for his hard earned $500,001.  

I don't think that the rich contribute taxes in good will, neither do I really care if the stock markets crash as I have little invested in it.

"&gt;They are not employees of Alaska. They are not travelling on business.

Yes, that is why *they* didn't get reimbursed . . . the Governor did.  They are traveling on business if the State wants the Governor's family to be at a certain location at a certain time.

&gt;Their travel is a income from her employer (to SP), not an expense, and therefore taxable income for S.Palin.

It is an expense.

&gt;""Washing"" the income through per-diems is a method of shielding her income from tax. And, a way to defraud the State (is it really policy/law for the state to pay for employee's vacations?)

Per-diem schedules are well-established by the State.  The Governor doesn't even submit her own per-diem expenses (I didn't when I worked for Alaska).  As long as she returns or waives all the non-valid reimbursement (which she did), it's perfectly legal.

If Michelle Obama (and their children) were reimbursed for their flight to the DNC, should they pay taxes on the reimbursement?  Would accepting that reimbursement be fraud?  No. Even though Michelle and the children were not employed by Obama's campaign or the DNC, their presence at the event was important, and a justified campaign/party expense.

Same goes for visits/photo-ops with the Governor and the Governor's family.  Sometimes it's important to have your family there.

"How do the flaws of a two-party system add any weight to your arguments? The fact that it is a problem doesn't also make it an excuse for not thinking.

""Your conclusion is based on faith and heresay"" - on what basis do you say that? If you were more of a thinking person, you'd realise that anyone who qualifies their conclusion with what is ""likely"" and ""I may be wrong"" is clearly not making a statement based on faith. Perhaps you're projecting again?

I stand corrected on Lyme disease; my apologies.

""What makes you believe in this likelihood?"" - historical context and prior voting behavior on behalf of the Democrats, for starters. What is the point of this question, when you believe the chances are even less?

""I take a position that falls outside the typical dualist narrative of American politics"" - and I can tell you are very proud of yourself for doing so. Congratulations. But perhaps it would be more impressive if you took positions based on rational arguments.

""There are no objective opinions if we take the definition that a proposition is only objective if it is free from personal judgment."" - true, but in the real world it is useful to be able to judge who is attempting to be objective, and who is not. So your definition there is completely worthless. I will confidently state I'm intelligent, and given a track record of exam results etc I can be fairly sure I am being reasonably objective in that self-assessment.

Conversely, as I have been pointing out your various mistakes, I can be fairly sure that it is not calm logic that has led you to your political beliefs.

Incidentally, about the Obama-drone comment: I'm not a drone, I just happen to think that in this particular case another Republican administration would be bad thing, and that Obama's policies on the whole are good enough not to fear him.

"America has all the qualifications to be deemed a fascist nation, or at the very least, an authoritarian plutocracy. The founders, were they alive today, would have been leading a bloody revolt against the establishment years ago.

I admit I was relieved when Obama won. It was so refreshing to see and hear so many people excited about the election, taking such an active role in it. The amount of participation and interest in politics during this election was unprecedented.

But just why were people so interested? Sadly, I don't think it was because they were interested in politics or the health of the nation. I think this grand upsurge in interest was only due to Obama's charming personality. He makes promise after promise, all of which give us ""hope"" that our corrupt state will ""change"" for the better. But how? How will he fulfill all of these promises? Print more money? Borrow more money? Use force?

The biggest problem with this large-scale interest in our government now is that it isn't focused on the important issues. People wanted to see the black man beat the white man, to see the young guy beat the old guy, to see the Republicans defeated. So Obama won: are we now under the impression that no one has to worry about anything anymore? With Bush gone and Obama in office, are people going to become even MORE blind to the atrocious actions of the State than they already are now?

If McCain had won, at least more people would have been angry. Hell, I would have been furious beyond description. At this moment in America's life, anger is exactly what we need most. Not blind loyalty and trust that everything is going to be okay because a silver-tongued charmer won the presidency.

We can't forget that Obama supported FISA, the illegal wire tapping program. Nor can we forget that both Obama and Biden voted for the bankers' bailout bill, which is indeed the greatest heist against the American population in the nation's history. And did you know that Obama supports a one-world government? No? It's unfortunately true.

We'll see what he does in time. I have a feeling he is going to fuck us, our liberties, and the Constitution.

We had two recessions in the 1950s, and Kennedy proposed tax cuts after the second one to stimulate growth.

President John F. Kennedy is not known for
his “conservatism,” but he did understand the
benefit of sound fiscal policy. “Recognizing that high tax rates were hindering the economy,”writes tax expert Dan Mitchell, “President Kennedy proposed across-the-board tax rate reductions that reduced the top tax rate from more than 90 percent down to 70 percent.” In a speech before the New York Economic Club, Kennedy explained the reason for his policy:

“In short, it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now.” 

Walter Heller, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, described the Kennedy tax cut as a “major factor that led to our running a $3 billion surplus by the middle of 1965 before escalation in Vietnam.

"Nowhere did I state that they are not publicly traded companies.

&gt; Who is in charge of those companies? The federal government

&gt; The government implicitly backs their debt; doing so gives them enormous control over their policies and passes on the risk of all problematic loans to the taxpayers.

If you were confused by what I meant when I said ""in charge of"", I clarified that in my next post. Now if you want to argue that they are not government-sponsored, then I am quite willing to contend that they are.

Also, while we continue quoting the NYT article, here is another juicy snippet:

&gt; Virtually every home mortgage lender, from giants like Citigroup to the smallest local banks, relies on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to grease the wheels of the mortgage market. Virtually every Wall Street bank does business with them. And investors around the world own $5.2 trillion of the debt securities backed by the companies. 

But yeah, I can see how they had nothing to do with this. Here's another NYT article disputing that contention, by the way:

http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/05/business/05freddie.html?_r=1

&gt; That chief executive, Richard F. Syron, in 2004 received a memo from Freddie Mac’s chief risk officer warning him that the firm was financing questionable loans that threatened its financial health.

&gt; In an interview, Freddie Mac’s former chief risk officer, David A. Andrukonis, recalled telling Mr. Syron in mid-2004 that the company was buying bad loans that “would likely pose an enormous financial and reputational risk to the company and the country.” 

&gt; But as they sat in a conference room, Mr. Syron refused to consider possibilities for reducing Freddie Mac’s risks, said Mr. Andrukonis, who left in 2005 to become a teacher. 

&gt; “He said we couldn’t afford to say no to anyone,” Mr. Andrukonis said. Over the next three years, Freddie Mac continued buying riskier loans.

&gt; Those and other choices initially paid off for Mr. Syron, who has collected more than $38 million in compensation since 2003.

&gt; But when housing prices began declining in 2006, choices at Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae proved disastrous. Stock prices at both companies have fallen by more than 60 percent since February, destroying more than $80 billion of shareholder value. 

&gt; Indeed, executives of both companies maintain that one of the reasons the firms hold so many bad loans is that Congress has leaned on them for years to buy mortgages from low-income borrowers to encourage affordable housing. In 2004, Freddie Mac warned regulators that affordable housing goals could force the company to buy riskier loans.

&gt; However, the companies were constantly under pressure to buy riskier mortgages. Once, a high-ranking Democrat telephoned executives and screamed at them to purchase more loans from low-income borrowers, according to a Congressional source. Shareholders attacked the executives for missing profitable opportunities by being too cautious. 

&gt; Mr. Syron and Mr. Mudd eventually yielded to those pressures, effectively wagering that if things got too bad, the government would bail them out. 

&gt; “The thinking was that if something really bad happened to the housing market, then the government would need Freddie and Fannie more than ever, and would have to rescue them,” Mr. Andrukonis said. “Everybody understood that at some level the company was putting taxpayers at risk.” ",false,true,t1_c07bwfo,fartymarti,,0,1233173299,t5_2cneq,t3_7t3bb,t1_c07bvwf,0,1425917794,0,0,c07bwfo,politics,0,,,

"You all might read the history of the public airwaves, or apply common sense. If everyone who wanted to run a radio station did so, the resulting amount of noise would make the medium untenable. We, as a nation, portioned out the airwaves by license and the FCC went after non-licensed operations (pirate radio). In turn, the license-holder had to operate in a manner consistent with serving with the public. 

I would guess most of you aren't old enough to remember past the Reagan years. The Fairness Doctrine worked.

More importantly, as their are only a small number of licenses covering the whole of the country (against population) it was also obvious that the rich &amp; powerful would buy up these stations . . . as they have.

If it is to be ""change we can believe in"" then the ""original intent"" ought to be in place, IMO, one owner (or group) per outlet with no ties to another other owner (-ship group).  Competition would make radio a far better place, same as with local television.

The five media companies of today swallowed the 2,000 largest media outlets extant as of 1970. If you think we are well-served by the present arrangement, or, more likely, are unable to imagine a better one, then know that we once had that, and it was far better.

There was never ANY reason to wind up with the system we have today except the capture of the broadcast industry to serve the rich.

Not only should we break them up, but they should also be required -- as part of that license -- to provide free time to political candidates at all levels. Bring back some sanity to that process.

"If Walmart is within a mile or two of my house, I'd consider it a ""local"" store.

Inefficiency due to low volumes is just the reality of business.  If you can't live with it, then you'll die.  Most mom and pop stores probably should go out of business.   They're an old style store that doesn't (generally) cut it nowadays.

I think it's about more than a simple inefficiency due to volume though, it's also about the consumer and the internet.  On the internet you can immediately compare prices between hundreds of companies and choose the lowest one.  This is actually closer to the ""ideal"" market than B&amp;M stores where there is a sizable cost associated with going from one store to another.

B&amp;Ms take advantage of having customers in their store.  They offer competitive prices on some items, and ridiculously inflated prices on other, smaller items.

"Regarding Stewart's apology:
I did not see it, as I am not a regular watcher of the show. If this is truly the case, I think that's great.

However, the view which he briefly espoused is a common one (Truman was a war criminal, the bomb was unnecessary, etc) and there is nothing wrong with someone tackling it in an extended manner, rather than in the glib soundbites that most ""news"" now consists of.

Stewart is trying to ride the fence between comedian and ""purveyor of truth,"" picking one or the other when it is convenient. He has built an *entire career* out of taking people to task for the stupid things that they say (often, I might add, in snippets sometimes taken out of context) . Why should he be treated any differently, just because later he say ""Oops, sorry about that."" 

Words mean things, and it's obvious from the context of the original clip, as he further explicates the matter, that he meant what he said. Which is wonderful.

"&gt; How many did Saddam kill

The largest number of people that Saddam Hussein killed was during the war of aggression against Iran that he waged -- with the US supplying Hussein with arms, money, chemical weapon precursors, satellite photos, and much other US support during that war.

Regarding the number of people that Hussein killed domestically while he was in power, he was a typical Arab dictator. The US supports many Arab dictators. Say what you will, but Hussein's killings were nowhere near 1 million.

Your argument is a pathetic attempt to justify two-faced US policies and a US war of aggression based on lies.

&gt; If the US just left with Saddam, how many Sunni, Shitte &amp; Kurds would have each killed.

We did just leave Hussein! In 1991 after the Gulf War when the US was paid (we even made a profit on that war!) to restore the Kuwaiti dictator to his throne, US President George H.W. Bush called on Iraqis to rebel. And the Iraqis did rebel, especially the Kurds and the Shiites in the South.

And what was the US response to that brave rebellion? The US approved Saddam Hussein's use of attack helicopters and stood by and watched the rebels be slaughtered.

That decision was made due to a ruthless, Machiavellian decision that it was better to have Saddam Hussein in power than to possibly break Iraq up into 3 areas.

There are *good* reasons millions of Iraqis hate the US. [There are *good* reasons a majority of Iraqis see the US as an occupying imperial power and want us to get out of their country.](http://therealnews.com/t/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=3971)

So is owning a firearm. But, do we expect the government to buy weapons and ammo for us?

Rights are recognized and protected by the government, as designed. They were never intended to be ""funded"" so you could exercise them. That's up to the individual.

In my opinion, the right to health care is *not* protected by the government at all. Because of all the BS you need to go through to give medical advise and treatment in this country, it is restricted. I am not against regulation in the medical industry, but the regulation mandated by the government has played a role in the cost of health care increasing to a point it's out of reach to most Americans now. That regulation has also fueled the greedy insurance companies to take advantage of it and more or less hijack the public at large.

I should have ""the right"" to be treated by Dr. Nick Mendoza, who has no certificates or degrees, if I choose I want to take the risk of being treated by him. But exercising that right in our broken health care system would land Dr. Mendoza in prison. I truly believe most people are not looking at the issue in its totality, or realistically.

"Why do you keep bringing up fraud? I'm talking about openly selling something that's dangerous, such as a heater with no grill in front, or child's toys with sharp pointy little pieces, or leaded paint.

There would be nothing fraudulent about selling leaded painted toys in a free market, and you're relying on the consumer base to setup and maintain a method of testing and rejecting toys which are so painted.  There would be no penalties in your system for selling these dangerous items, except that perhaps people would buy less of them.  Since it would be cheaper to make though, many would still be sold.

I just don't agree with you that selling shit products will not be profitable in the short term, and there are many examples to back this claim.  A weakening of consumer protection laws does not seem like a good way to improve the quality of the goods and services available to the public, only to lower the quality and prices.

"You miss the whole point of the fig tree lesson, and it shows you misunderstand something fundamental. That tree was created by God. It was his to do with what he wanted. He used it for a purpose to teach a lesson, which you seemingly missed. I gather you live in a house and have furniture. You write on paper or and even use it to wipe your rear end. I doubt you have even planted a single tree in you whole life, and even if you had, you didn't create the tree you planted. Most people who do plant trees do not do it for the good of the tree, but to add value to their own property. What I am getting at is the use of those wood products (killing trees to make the things you use every day) is not for the tree's benefit, and you probably aren't replacing the number of trees you use up each year. And yet, you are whining that God has offended your sensibilities by daring to curse a fig tree that was his to begin with and served a purpose to teach something fundamental. You complain about Christ supposedly “instilling fear” and yet you would do the very same thing to warn a loved one about some avoidable danger about to befall them. “Look both ways before crossing the street or you'll be hit by a car. Don't play with fire or you'll get burned. ” How horrible of mothers and fathers to instill fear in their kids by warning them of cars and fire, right? Sheesh. 

The bible does not say that Christ wanted everyone to be carpenters or walk around exchanging miracles for food and lodging. Again, you miss the whole point: Christ is the Word made Flesh, the Son of God, One with the Father. He could very well have just created food for himself and others. We have examples of this in the Bible, again, which you seemed to have missed. (Loaves and fishes, feeding thousands, turning water to wine, etc.) Christ lived a life subject to and dependent on God the Father, and his whole reason for being here was to save us. He became flesh, a man, and allowed himself to be subject to our weaknesses and dependencies. He did this out of love and to teach us a something about depending on God and trusting Him to take care of us. Trusting God is the message, not “be a carpenter.” (Although there is symbolism in Christ's work as a carpenter, Christ isn't telling everyone to make furniture.)

You are so busy, apparently, trying to nit pick God that you miss the most fundamental messages of Christ. You are like one of these ADHD kids who, when presented with a basic math lesson, run around screaming “but, but, I already know how to add.” The fact is, apparently you don't. Just like the kid who doesn't understand that math knowledge is cumulative, you are getting distracted about criticisms you think you invented. Funny, that is.  

Here is something you may not want to hear, or maybe you don't care. Christ said that there are some people who don't hear his voice, and they are not his. (Basically, he said that those who are his, hear his voice, to paraphrase.) He is speaking to all who will hear, truly, but people have free will and some chose not to hear. Instead of whining about how you don't understand, or more accurately, claiming that you do understand when you haven't got a freaking clue, why don't you start simply. Christ taught lots of things, and if you approach them as a child, you'll understand. Your problem is not that you are too stupid to get it, but that you don't believe in the first place. What that means is you won't have access to the message of Christ. It is like you don't know what spanning tree is, but you are trying to create mathematical proofs of Kruskal's algorithm. The obvious route is “you can't see the forest for the trees.”

"Reaganomics wasn't just about President Reagan, it was about a new economic philosophy. A philosophy that's demonstrably wrong and yet forms, in different ways, the foundation of economic thought for the neoconservatives and the libertarians. It's that philosophy that I took to task, and it's that taking to task you didn't actually respond to. Did something else cause the massive merger wars of the 80s? Did something else create the ""too big to fail"" corporations? Do you have a response to what I posted or is it just ""you're uneducated and I'm right""? 

Regarding the disappearance of the middle class, it's really more complex than currency debasement. When the richest 1% own more than the poorest 95%, CEOs of large corporations make 500 times what the average employee makes, and the nations 13,000 wealthiest families receive as much income as the poorest 20 million families in America, we have to face the fact that the middle class disappearing has a lot to do with dangerously uneven wealth distribution, the kind one might normally expect to find in South America where oligarchies rule. But that's just one factor among many. Globalization leading to offshoring is partially responsible for the decline of the middle class. Declining manufacturing in the US id partially responsible for the decline of the middle class. I could go on and on all day naming things which have nothing to do with currency debasement which have a demonstrable link to the decline of the middle class. The fact you've not been able to figure these out and a pop-economist like me can suggests to me that you're letting ideology get in your way. 

The main issue I take here is your baseless assumption that a free market means that everyone's playing by the same rules. It is the quintessential libertarian fallacy. In what world do you live in? Person A is born into poverty and person B is born into money. That's just what happens. Because person A is born into poverty, person A is less likely to have a balanced diet. Person A is more likely to have crime in his environment. Person A is much more likely to attend an inferior school. Person A has to start working earlier. Person A is many times more likely to be abused or neglected by a parent. Even if person A does everything right, avoiding gangs and hard drugs, doing well in school, earning a scholarship or 10 or 15 to pay for a decent school, the odds of ever being rich are incredibly low.

"You misunderstood. The comment is not about whether you are paying more or less than your peers; the comment is about whether hospitals would charge you more or less in a world without a crazy bloated insurance industry. 

So:

1) Bills are inflated because of the bloated insurance industry pricing club, meaning for example a procedure that might otherwise be priced at $X might be priced at $1.3X. 

2) Insurance is not a profit-making investment for any individual. You are charged _more_ than your expected gain to protect you against the possibility that you end up costing a lot more than we reasonably expect you will. 

3) The insured likely do subsidize the uninsured. That wasn't in contention, above. That also does not tell us whether people with insurance pay more or less, just that part of their cost (which may be higher or lower than mine--they likely seek treatment differently than I do, are affected by illness differently, etc.) is absorbed by my bill.

You are forgetting that many contracts are more than the course of one year.

&gt;Red Herring. The amendment doesn't say that arbitration can never be used, and talking about the fearful possibilities of it doesn't mean they are true, or that this will be the end result.

Binding Arbitration means that both parties HAVE to go to arbitration.  Even though companies routinely lose, overall the process is designed to save time and money. No one will agree to arbitration if it's voluntary.  So in effect if the company or employee cannot stipulate arbitration, it won't happen.

Example, I can decide that each and every company I work with agree to binding arbitation.  This bill says that I could no longer stipulate that as part of a private contract.

"My idea for the Libertarian platform for this year:

Issue #1 - stop the bleeding on healthcare.

I believe the libertarian attack on this would be the most pragmatic.  The current problem with health-care is from the pooling of resources beyond individual control.  The stop the bleeding **all libertarians should call for an immediate government ban of non-monetary compensation for employment, including health care**

Note this may lead to a more socialized system in the future, but we need to immediately restore market fundamentals to the health care market as a first step.

After this, we can argue the merits of government utility of health care, like we do with police and fire services.  I have never met a fellow libertarian who is for the disbandment of law enforcement, which is big point separating us from anarchists.

I strongly believe arguing the merits of basic health care as a government utility is not anti-libertarian.  However, I believe having the government run the system would be though, and I think its important for libertarians to point out this philosophical difference, and stop letting other parts define the libertarian position for us.

There should be some very minor oversight on a long-term basis to make sure that things are not going wrong, but it should mostly be as independent as possible.  Why?  Because politicians are terrible at understanding complex issues, and the stability of the economy and the currency is a very complex issue best left to experts.

"What data do you need exactly?

It's a known fact that the Federal government forced banks to give out loans to people who would most likely default on them.  It's another known fact that many of these people did default on their loans which played a role in the economic crisis.  Was it the *entire* reason behind the economic collapse?  No, of course not.  But the government certainly had a hand in it.

And you interestingly leave out the proceeding paragraphs from the exact wikipedia post you used:

&gt;Some economists, politicians and other commentators have charged that the CRA contributed in part to the 2008 financial crisis by encouraging banks to make unsafe loans. Others however, including the economists from the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, dispute this contention. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC holds that empirical research has not validated any relationship between the CRA and the 2008 financial crisis.[98][99]

&gt;Economist Stan Liebowitz wrote in the New York Post that a strengthening of the CRA in the 1990s encouraged a loosening of lending standards throughout the banking industry. He also charges the Federal Reserve with ignoring the negative impact of the CRA.[93] In a commentary for CNN, Congressman Ron Paul, who serves on the United States House Committee on Financial Services, charged the CRA with ""forcing banks to lend to people who normally would be rejected as bad credit risks.""[100] In a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, Austrian school economist Russell Roberts wrote that the CRA subsidized low-income housing by pressuring banks to serve poor borrowers and poor regions of the country.[101] Jeffrey A. Miron, a senior lecturer in economics at Harvard University, in an opinion piece for CNN, calls for “getting rid” of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as policies like the Community Reinvestment Act that “pressure banks into subprime lending.”

Now we could argue what the exact percentage of the housing crisis was due to these bad loans.  But to pretend as though these bad loans had *nothing* to do with it is simply absurd.",false,true,t1_c0g6yo8,shiner_man,,0,1259011013,t5_2cneq,t3_a73za,t1_c0g6xl4,0,1426138966,0,0,c0g6yo8,politics,0,,,

Appealing to emotion is, I think, evidence of a weak or non-existent argument. Do I think people should get medical treatment if they need it? Absolutely. How we do it matters. Pushing through some government fix without reasoned debate and a dispassioned look at resources vs need is foolish.

It is in the Koran. There is no moderate Islam. There are just moderate people. Religion is a disease, both there and here, in any shape or form. Islam is a particularly aggressive religion, Christianity for example is reasonably benign in comparison (you can leave without being killed, to paraphrase Dawkins) However, Religion is a million times more dominant there than it is here.

Interesting though that you quoted my statement about ""the average muslims opinion has very little to do with your academic rambling about the last 50 years or black op operations to support Iranian oppositions, wikipedia links etc"" without actually addressing it.

Thats why they scream and burn stupid flags and bomb themselves and us and behead people and beat women and mutilate young girls vaginas. Because a comic is enough. Because being an infidel is enough. Because democratic decisions in Switzerland are enough, because being a woman is enough. Because an old book is enough. Its always enough, somehow, someway.

"&gt;First, arguments stand on their own regardless of other arguments presented along with them. Second, a documentary does not need to present the opinion of individuals who are under investigation for the documentary to be good.

IMO, you just described a propaganda film and a justification for the, ""Wake up sheeple!"" meem. Quite frankly, in order for a documentary to be a good, credible source of information, it *needs* to present both sides of an issue. If it only presents one, it's only selling one side of the story; as such, viewers cannot discern bias and fiction from fact. Second, a good argument counters an opponents facts and can only do so by presenting the opponents argument. Go ask any good english teacher on this matter. Fail to do so on such an essay debating some issue and you'll receive an F grade.

&gt;'Harvest of Fear' is not ""much better"" - it merely supplies the GM corporation-approved messages about the claimed benefits of GMO. Some people will hear that to exclusion of all else 

Yeah, and some people only hear the propaganda in FoF to all else. The only way to make sure neither scenario happens, to make sure no one listens to only one side, is to have people investigate both independently or watch a documentary that provides both sides, which is why I suggested HoF as it is ""much better"". In other words, HoF forces one to think about arguments from both sides and think critically about claims made by both. Think of it this way:FoF=Fox news, HoF=some imaginary, nonexistent, news agency that objectively presents unbiased investigative reports. Oh, well, I guess that's kind of like Nova/Frontline.

This is far from irrefutable. More research has to be done to provide concrete evidence. Note, I'm not denying it, I'm just denying credible evidence and am open to the possibility.

"tl:dr  I don't think automation of ticketing is wrong, as long as you have the opportunity to challenge the ticket, but what they are trying to do in AZ is make it so that sending something first class is the same as serving someone and eliminating your ability to address a situation where you might not even know you had been accused of a crime.

I have gotten an automated enforcement ticket and beaten it.  This was in NM not AZ.  I received letter a picture of my car and stating that I was driving 33mph in a 15mph school zone.  It had the date and time of the infraction as well as the name of the officer who was manning the radar and camera.

The ticket clearly stated you could protest the ticket on 4 grounds:

1. that it was an emergency.
2. that road conditions forced it.
3. ???
4. that you were not driving

Anyway, I protested it on the fact that the school zone was not in effect when the ticket was issued. The ticket was issued at 8:31 and the school zone normally ends at 8:30.

I went to the traffic court before a judge and a the cop who issued the ticket.  the cop looked at his log of tickets, saw that right after he issued it he could no longer see the crossing guard who turns on or off the lights, so he asked the judge to dismiss.  I didn't even have to say anything other than I didn't believe the lights were on when I was driving through the zone.

So you can fight the ticket.  You probably won't win because you actually did break the law, but if you didn't they will dismiss it.

But what if I didn't get the initial letter?  Mail does get lost.  There needs to be a way to address the issue that you never knew you had been accused in the first place.

"I understand that this is *not* the healthcare bill that you (or I) wanted.  But there are significant reforms in the bill, and to say otherwise is rubbish.  (Also, we don't yet know which provisions from which bill will be in the final bill)

* Allows children to stay on their parents plan until 26 or 27
* Creation of a health insurance exchange to facilitate insurance purchase for individuals and small business 
* Steps toward eliminating the Medicare donut hole
* Expands Medicaid coverage to the poor
* Subsidies/credits for people up to 400% of [poverty line](http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/09poverty.shtml) ($44,000 individual, $88,000 family of 4)
* Eliminates rescissions for almost any reason other than not paying your premium
* Eliminates coverage denials because of pre-existing conditions


And, as much as I hate the idea of a mandate, that we are *forced* to buy insurance, I have to agree that it's necessary.


If we do not allow insurers to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, and we *don't* require people to buy insurance, nobody will have incentive to purchase insurance **until** they get sick.  After all, they cannot be denied coverage because they are sick.  I certainly wouldn't purchase health insurance until I got sick (maybe catastrophic insurance for accidents).  But I wouldn't buy any sort of comprehensive plan.  Because I know that **if** I get sick, they **have** to sell me insurance.


I don't like the mandate, but I think it's the price we pay for eliminating denials based on pre-existing conditions.

Yes.  Sorry, I don't believe in lobby groups at all.  I thinking lobbying, be it for wall street or a non-profit, should be flat out outlawed.  I think there should be citizen caps to donations to politicians as well. 

Everyone has one vote, one voice, and their own money as an individual.   This alone should decide who gets in office and what public opinion is for what bills get introduced and passed by that politician.

Rich people *do* receive more government benefits, albeit indirectly. Just because you don't get a check in the mail doesn't mean you're not benefiting from the government financially. Things like food safety and security against theft are essential, which means that if the government wasn't doing it for you private enterprise would have to do it. Which means you'd have to pay for it. Which means that the government is saving you money on these things. How much?

"Yes, we've all seen the handful of letters from Lincoln.  Yet, at the time, he was seen as the ""abolishionist president"" throughout the south - the declarations of secession for several states say this explicitly:

South Carolina: 

&gt; ""a geographical line has been drawn across the Union, and all the States north of that line have united in the election of a man to the high office of President of the United States, whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery.""

Georgia: 

&gt; ""The Presidential election of 1852 resulted in the total overthrow of the advocates of restriction and their party friends. Immediately after this result the anti-slavery portion of the defeated party resolved to unite all the elements in the North opposed to slavery and to stake their future political fortunes upon their hostility to slavery everywhere. This is the party two whom the people of the North have committed the Government. They raised their standard in 1856 and were barely defeated. They entered the Presidential contest again in 1860 and succeeded.""  

Texas:

&gt; ""And, finally, by the combined sectional vote of the seventeen non-slaveholding States, they have elected as president and vice-president of the whole confederacy two men whose chief claims to such high positions are their approval of these long continued wrongs, and their pledges to continue them to the final consummation of these schemes for the ruin of the slave-holding States. ""

Alabama:

&gt; ""Whereas, the election of Abraham Lincoln and Hannibal Hamlin to the offices of president and vice-president of the United States of America, by a sectional party, avowedly hostile to the domestic institutions and to the peace and security of the people of the State of Alabama""

Kentucky:

&gt; the President and Congress ... have thus substituted for the highest forms of national liberty and constitutional government a central despotism founded upon the ignorant prejudices of the masses of Northern society, and instead of giving protection with the Constitution to the people of fifteen States of this Union have turned loose upon them the unrestrained and raging passions of mobs and fanatics

(translation:  The federal government is now in the hands of the prejudiced ""mob"" - i.e. the abolishionists).

I'm not disputing that the slavery was constititionally protected, nor that the secession of the states was illegal (I'm not enough of a Constititional buff to determine that, but it seems to me they had legal grounds for grievance against the federal government).  But S.C. and the rest were seceding in order to protect the institution of slavery - it's clearly stated in their official documents.  To say that slavery is ""the easy answer"" is disingenuous.

What's ironic is that secession only accelerated the end of slavery.  Had they remained part of the union, there never would have been enough states to ratify the 13th Amendment.  The slaveholding states clearly saw the writing was on the wall; with the move to block slavery in new territories, they would have eventually been outnumbered and slavery abolished altogether, but it would have taken decades.

The situation is not dissimilar to the controversy around gay marriage right now.  The champions of ""opposite marriage"" see that public opinion is rapidly moving in favor of allowing full rights for gay folk, so they resort to desperate measures (ballot initiatives, constitutional amendments at the state level, etc.)  They have yet to resort to secession, despite teabaggers' cries of such, but it's the same idea:  the tide is moving and they're powerless to stop it.",false,true,t1_c0l1vea,steve_b,,0,1266939996,t5_2cneq,t3_b50vi,t1_c0l1tbi,0,1426222971,0,0,c0l1vea,politics,0,,,

"Okay, here's some food for thought, and then I'm outta here:

There is a nice list that you can find online somewhere that tells you how you can tell if your country is going fascist. It lists such things as:
-- politicians attacking their opponents and accusing them of being agents of outside enemies, 
-- politicians wrapping themselves around the flag, excessive patriotic fervor, 
-- denial of habeus coripus, 
-- creation of concentration camps (e.g., Gitmo)
-- executive branch refusing to recognize power of legislature to check and balance, 
-- wars of aggression
-- government essentially being in partnership with the rich industrialists of that society and helping make them filthy rich while the rest of populations struggles to eek out and existence, etc...

The name socialist being part of the Nazi party name is common ploy often used by fascists by calling something a name that is the opposite of what it really is or does. So for example the act of leaving the poorest neediest children behind by cutting their funding program became NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND.  An operation to destroy the lives of the iraqi people and wreak havoc on their country and killing hundredds of thousands of them, turning their country into a terrorist training ground, and displacing them by the millions and even facilitate ethnic cleansing became known as OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM etc.......

Now do you get it?  It should be disturbingly familiar considering the first 8 years of the decade.

During Hitler's reign, there was no redistribution of wealth.  The economy was heavily regulated by the government, true, but for the most part the wealthy kept their margin of profits.

"OK, I can see your point.  Is there a double standard ? Yes But not all people can be lumped into your argument. 

I am not refuting its existence.  I just take umbrage to the use of a blanket statement for protesters as racist as I think that race is not the only motivator. 

Honestly, I see where they (as I do) see a threat with the *further* growth of an already huge government. (Even though bush also grew it.) Please hear me out, I am trying to give an honest accounting.  At what point do you say or I or the ordinary citizen say enough is enough ?  Perhaps *perceived growth* has given them the final push. 

Let me flesh that out : I *perceive* the D's the left / liberalism on the whole as supporters of big government and do not directly associate them symbolically with president Obama.  I also fear a congress and senate with unchecked democrat power making policy. Basically the whole govt has a Democratic majority and freedom to grow itself and I think that is dangerous.    

 Perhaps others see it as a crucial moment as the D prez, a D congress, and a D senate represent something of a totalitarian regime. Again its a matter of perception. I do not remember in my 40+ years of a Government so controlled by one party.  Not even the ""revolution"" and contract with America days.  Again its perception.
 
I disagree with you on that guns part. As I follow it more closely than the issues you list. Supreme court had the DC pistol case and others that have brought it to the forefront.

"&gt;Oil companies are trying to make the most money they can while keeping their stockholders happy. If you think of an oil company from a financial point of view, they have assets and liablilities. Every drop of gasoline you pump into your car is an asset that the oil companies can't recover--it's gone.

You absolutely nailed this. Thank you for the excellent post. 
To blame the current administration of all of a sudden becoming a traitor to the American people by jumping on the petroleum industry expansion band wagon is a false, incomplete and incoherent comprehension. 

Administrations that run current policy in America have been in part “OIL TRIBE” proxies since before World War II, if not much earlier. That especially makes all of us on this planet that are totally connected to the consumption of oil Petroleum Industry proxies also. Pointing blame to any single sources of government leadership or industry is weak, and non helpful in this immensely complicated discussion about oil. 

**Current Earth rule number one**: The “OIL TRIBE” rules the planet. We may naively choose to believe that our elected governments rule our countries and planet, but that is a false assumption. The folks that are involved with the production and distribution of our current economic blood are in charge.  

**Current Earth rule number two**: The “CONSUMER TRIBE” facilitates, and perpetuates the national and international policy and economic wealth of the the “OIL TRIBE.” This is not an “Us versus Them” scenario, because we are part of them, but we are mostly just not economically conscious enough to understand that we have allowed a huge “OIL TRIBE” to be in charge of our Earth’s oil drug trade.   

The oil company drug dealers are very astute thinkers, and they know that they currently have the collective global economy by the balls in nothing less than a vice-grip, so it is in their best interest, which is in the best interest of their stock investors to keep a tight leash on the supply for as long as they can.

Until we petroleum consumers, especially Americans more fully realize that we are nearly 100% dependent on this drug called Black Gold, we will be at the not always cool mercy that an oil economy dictates living rules to us.

This relationship can only change if we want it to, but as it is right now, that is a near impossibility without great awareness and some severe educational attitude adjustments. Oil has in a way spoiled us, given us a better way of living, and we mostly are not willing to grasp the hidden costs to being spoiled by oil. 

I am not saying “Oil Companies” are evil, because that would mean we consumers are evil by the very nature of our complacent participation in our oil dependent economy. We are naive, and until recently, mostly unwilling to escape our bubble of naivete comfort about our implicit relationship with stuff like offshore oil drilling.   

It is not a laughing point here, but the truth is, independent government leaders that we fear as being dictators, or traitors to our way of living and policy change promises are really nothing in comparison to the already existing ""Oil Dictators"" that rule how we live on Earth. The “Oil Tribe” dictation upon our way of life economy may not appear to be the case, but they are indeed what currently calls the shots. 

Government leaders and philosophies will come and go, but for the near future, our extreme addiction to petroleum will always be there, until we fully comprehend and collectively acknowledge how huge our lust is for a petroleum based lifestyle. So do not blame government policy and the “Oil Tribe” for selling us out, because we are already selling ourselves out by inaction towards mobilizing alternative energy and consumption futures. 

If you do not want expansion of off shore oil drilling, prepare to get uncomfortable and make you brain and body sweat. While I am not thrilled with the idea of offshore oil resource expansion, the global “Consumer Tribe” is essentially saying, “We really do not care, just bring us our drug and the easy oil lubricated lifestyle we are used too.”   

**Options**: Alternative Energy. Conservation. Immense Transportation Overhaul. Urban Habitat Planning Overhaul. And of course the one anti-growth put fear in the hearts of business as usual system modeler tribes people: Population Growth and Decline issues mediation.

The other option is of course to wait around basically doing nothing but picking our noses, while being distracted with non-essential social economic realities, until the price of a gallon of gas reaches $8 USD and $16 USD in Europe, which of course will cause ugly riots and severe economic chaos. 

Yes, that future will be extremely ugly if people are willing to remember what happened when a gallon hit a mere $4.50 USD just a few years ago.

You're absolutely wrong about that. I applaud Van Jones admitting he's a Marxist. I want Anita Dunn to tell us why she admires Mao so much. I think it's great that Obama said in his book that he sought out radical Marxists while in college. Without them speaking their minds it would be my empty accusations against their deception. So you're so fucking wrong when you think I only want to be heard and others shouldn't. It was Obama who said we should shut up and get out of the way. Not me.

"&gt;The GOP have convinced the masses to continue ""supporting the American Dream,"" selling them a pipe-dream that 90% of people will never achieve

What is the ""American Dream""?  I thought it was owning a home, having a decent car and a dependable job - in addition to all of the necessities.  I still think that's achievable.  I only have a high school education with some college and I'm making 50K a year, I've been at the same job for 5 years now, and I'm looking at buying my piece of heaven with all the money I have in savings.  I didn't really do anything special - I just never took on any debt, never lived outside my means, and I studied and learned my own interest in my spare time, getting my foot in the door at a company that didn't care so much about degrees as they did ability.  I am finishing college now, tuition paid for by my employer.  

I doubt I could have accomplished this anywhere else save for a handful of capitalist countries -- places like Hong Kong/Japan.  I'd be eaten alive by licensing fees and taxes.

In spite of how flawed I am as a human being, I'm making out alright here.  The vast majority of the taxes I've paid in my life could have just been left out and I'd be doing even better than I am now.  Outside of fuel and other vehicle taxes for the roads, I've hardly seen any substantive benefit for what I've paid in.

If anything, big government, high taxes, a vast array of mismanaged social programs, attempts to regulate personal behavior that harms no one, and Imperial wars are the primary threat to the ""American Dream"".  I know some of you may say taxes aren't as high as other countries, but if you look at what we get for paying ""our share"", it should be obvious that they're much higher - because we get shit, basically.

"&gt;Her comments were based on the fact that a majority of Israelis are actually immigrants from Europe.

Except that the majority of Israeli Jews are actually Sfardi and Mizrachi.

&gt;There's different types of jews. There's Ashkanazi jews, and there's Sephardic jews. Ashkenazis are immigrants, Sephardics are arabic. Arabic jews are semites, Ashkenazis aren't.

This is entirely wrong.  All ethnic Jews are Semites, including the Ashkenazim.  There were other hypotheses that were tested in rigorous scientific studies, and proven wrong.

Ashkenazim spent most of their Diaspora in Western-Northern Europe, followed by Eastern Europe.

Sfardim spent most of their Diaspora in the Iberian Peninsula and southern Europe, followed by Turkey and the rest of the Mediterranean when the Christians cleansed their original areas of Jews.

Mizrachi Jews are some of the oldest Diaspora communities; their communities in the Middle East date back to the Babylonian and Persian Empires, to the destruction of the First Temple.  They were, for a long time, Arabic and Persian speaking, but they are not Arabs (except for the Yemeni).  They are what was in the Middle East *before* Arabs.

"Hey I agree with you too.  I wasn't arguing the correctness of the blockade.  A continued blockade will not be effective in accomplishing the goals they seek.  I feel bad for the suffering people who care nothing for the conflict and just want to live their lives in peace.  You also know that Israel would end this blockade instantly if their kidnapped soldier was returned.  It blows my mind the Hammas refuses to accept this deal and it also is crazy that Israel would blockade all these people for a single soldier.  Both sides are fuct and BOTH governments have actively decided to allow the people of Gaza to suffer.

Anyways, I was arguing that some people here are too quick to rant about violations of international law and Israelis attacking peaceful activists.  Fact is they broke no laws by enforcing their blockade outside their territorial waters.  They also jumped into a situation expecting no resistance, which was far from what they landed in.  Deadly force could have been avoided if they boarded the ship more cautiously.  They boarded with no escape route, it was obvious immediately that plenty of force would be needed to repel the attackers.  I do not blame those soldiers as it is highly likely that they would not have survived otherwise.

In the end Israel can not back down to activists like this.  Otherwise next time the activists are against something Israel is doing they will come in 10 times the numbers.  Very similar to the US refusing to negotiate with the ransom demands of kidnappers.  I am sure they will ease this blockade as the dust settles from this incident, they need to regain some public image..  They have already increased the types of goods allowed into Gaza.

"The US spends just over a trillion a year on the military (military budget plus emergency supplemental appropriations bills).  The Afghanistan and Iraq wars directly take about 4% of the federal budget.  

Entitlements are more, but military spending is, by far, the biggest single part of the Federal budget.  BTW, since politicians are unwilling to cut budgets or raise taxes, the US pays for its military by borrowing (much from China, Russia, and oil producing countries).

Cutting military spending is one of the only parts of the budget where the cuts don't adversely effect Americans.  Cut spending on education, kids suffer.  Cut spending on food stamps or unemployment, families go hungry.  

Military spending is way beyond out of control.  The US has given in to what the framers of the constitution feared:  maintaining a standing army.  Politically there seems to be no easy way out of maintaining the American Empire (40,000 troops in Japan, 35,000 in Korea, 120,000 in Europe, Iraq 90,000, Afghanistan 100,000).

Your claim that Israel didn't get most of the fertile land in the partition plan is false. They may have got the negev but they also got most of the fertile lands on the coast and in the north. 

&gt;Secondly, for years coming up to the 67' war hundreds of missiles and artillery were fired from Syria into Israeli farms and towns.

"&gt;The mandate's structured as a conditional tax. That's not bullshit: that's an objective fact. If you don't have health insurance, then you pay this extra tax.

The only people who would suffer an increase are the uninsured, but that's offset by the fact that those too poor to afford insurance get additional credits.

There is one big problem with this argument.  

There is nothing to garuntee that it will be a net wash.

&gt; If we were to do that we could raise the taxes on the wealthy substantially and still be well below other countries tax rates for the same brackets.

How would getting the tax rates for the wealthy at an attractive level that keeps them home result in an *increase* of taxes, when you yourself said that companies currently ditch the U.S. to avoid taxes?

&gt; A small portion ""trickles down."" Reagan's trickle down economics was give big business and wealthy huge tax breaks and subsidies and most of it will trickle down. Most of it stays where it started, meager scraps drip down.

What's your reasoning for this? Even rich CEOs who give themselves huge bonuses employ gardeners, maids, and buy lots of expensive products from companies who pay their employees who spend that money on cheaper products from people who earn a lot less. For the money not to trickle down on a major level, you'd have to transport rich people to their own private island where they weren't allowed to leave or trade with any outsiders.

They crashed the plane into the South Tower at 9:03 a.m, triggering the tower's destruction hours later.[13][20][25][27][28][29][30] The plane penetrated through the tower, and part of the plane's landing gear and fuselage  came out the north side of the tower and crashed through the roof of 45–47 Park Place, and through two of its floors. The plane parts destroyed three floor beams, and severely compromised the building's internal structure.[13][20]

This IT isn't the christian way which permeates america right now.

Using the term ""christian"" in a german context implies a context overarching even the diverging different christian sects.
And alot of the moral groundwork of the new testament is applicable, even set into a non theistic context.

I myself can't even remeber when ""god"" stopped to be a ""real"" entity and started to be an analogy to me. I still can suscribe what I was told a ""christian worldview"" would be (as oposed to strong catholic, or something other specific.)

"Ok. There are a couple of things I have to point out here.

&gt;The scientist have been talking about this for nearly 30 years, you think we would have noticed something by now

http://americasclimatechoices.org/climate_change_2008_final.pdf

This is a report from 2008 by the National Academies of Science and Engineering and the National Research Council. Here's a quote from the first page of the report

*Temperatures have already risen 1.4°F since the start of the 20th
century—with much of this warming occurring in just the last 30 Years — and temperatures will likely rise at least another 2°F, and possibly more than 11°F, over the next 100 years. This warming will cause significant changes in sea level, ecosystems, and ice cover, among other impacts. In the Arctic, where temperatures have increased almost twice as much as the global average, the landscape and ecosystems are already changing rapidly.*

Of course, this doesn't mean that doomsday is near nor does it mean that New York will be submerged in 5 years time, but to claim that we haven't noticed anything till now is not true at all.

&gt;People like Al Gore overstate the case in clearly exaggerated claims, such as sea levels rising 20 ft this century.

Yes, this is clearly a problem, but you then say

&gt;I haven't seen a debate of any kind, seems like something that should occur (Maybe Al Gore vs top skeptic)

If you think Al Gore is exaggerating the impact of climate change, why have him in your debate? Why not have a real scientist who has studied climate change.

At any rate, the report by the national academies is pretty convincing, unless you have an innate mistrust of groups of scientists.

&gt;It used to be called global warming, but changed to be called climate change to include any change in the climate as linked to CO2 emissions.

"My Day in court, I'm a Demologist

Finally my day has come for my religion to be recognized and must be considered in court. Just in the nick of time as I’m going to court today on charges, whew.

 Guard: Mr. Abdul it is time for court, please place your hands through the bars  so we may handcuff you. 

 Me: This is outrageous ,my Religion expressly forbids the shackling of all believers of demology!!!

 guard: yea ,yea ,tell it to the judge!!!

Me: I will!!!

In courtroom.

Judge : Mr. Abdul we are here today for your trial, are you ready to defend yourself ? 

 Me: Yes your honor but first you must consider my religion!!!!

Judge : And what may I ask is that? 

 Me: I'm a demologist which has it's roots in very ancient religions . Much like another religion  ,that presumes all women are inferior and guilty by their very being  we also conclude that all democrats are guilty by their very being. As you know women are forever tempting us by their having breasts, according to these old ancient religious laws. Democrats are forever tempting us with free money, they are just simply evil!! As you should know judge my religion expressly forbids me being judged by any man but only by my god, mobaloney! It expressly says that any man attempting to judge me must instead be judged by ME!!!  So we need to go by my religious laws ,asham.

 Judge: But that would mean That I'm the defendant and you are he judge!!!

 Me: Yes , you catch on quickly but perhaps too late! 

 Judge now referred  to as ex judge : But wait,

 ME: Silence!!!! Baliff please restrain the defendant!!!

 Me: Now  my first order of business is that all democrats present when an attempt is made to judge a demologist must forfeit 50% of their assets!!!! Ah I’m sorry I only follow the   asham laws and you agree we must go by the laws, yes?

 Crowd, gasping!

 Me: Silence ,according to asham law i am entitled due to the religious injustices i have suffered here today!!! Besides I  will use your money to stimulate the economy!!!

 Now defendant you are charged with the crime of rape of a young woman named, 
gaby abby.

 eX judge: this is outrageous that is my daughter!!!

Me: Yes i agree it is outrageous that you committed this crime!!!

 Ex judge;  But i'm innocent!!!!

 ME: That is what they all say !!!

Me: Now for the evidence, are you a democrat?? 

 Ex judge: I don't see whatttttt 

Me: Silence!!!!!  Asham law says that is all that matters!!!!! Are you a democrat????

Ex judge well yes!!

 Me: Then you are obviously guilty!!!!! 

 Ex Judge,  but i'm innocent.

Me:  We have already gone into that ,you have had a fair hearing according to my god the great mobaloney. We have gone strictly by those  laws asham. Does the defendant have anything else to say?

 eX judge but, but ,but,

 Me; Very well in the name  of mobaloney i sentence you to life in prison. Now according to asham law I’m entitled to all of your fortune now and all of the women in your family are now members of my harem!!! 

Ex judge: but they didn't do anything!!!

 Me: I'm entitled !!!!! My religion is  based on other religious laws more than a thousand years old!!!! Do you object to being judged by the laws of asham? Please remember those that offend mobaloney are subject to death threats and worse.

 Ex judge, trembling , uuhhh no your uhh your honor i guess


Me: take the prisoner away bailiff !!! 

 Me: Wait !!! I have one last thing to say to this prisoner! 
 I do want to thank you for considering my religion in ,well now i guess it is my courtroom, and one more thing,

 Ex judge  Yes your honor?

 Me: Have a nice day!!!!!

 Please help me file my religion in your local courthouse. As you can see it might not be thousands of years old but its laws are based on  other religions  that are more than a thousand years old !!!


 Praise mobaloney!!! And may asham always be with you!!!

"&gt;  I'll let you have the last word.

thanks.

&gt; Are you serious? You are claiming that it is free market economics that is disrupting opportunity?! Incredible.

the fact that income is distributed at increasingly disproportional rates is directly related to the decrease in quality of life for those who are born into low income society.  one of the properties of this diminished quality of life is a loss of opportunity.  they will not have access to the same education, nutrition, health care or healthy environment.  so yes, reganomics and conservative policy disrupts opportunity for a *significant* number of americans.

&gt;  Stop lying about what I said.

i haven't done that.  you said ""we're going to give unnaturally large power to select people and that will fix the greed.""  that's exactly what democracy is.  the constitution gives us the power to select people who will protect the rights of citizens and maintain some semblance of balance in our nation.  if by ""select people"" you mean single out the top two percent of earners for the conservative-planned tax cut expiration, then i'd say as long as it's approved by a democratically elected government, then it is democracy in action.

as for being ""off the deep end"", that's the only argument you even tried to make against anything i said (an exceedingly weak one at that).  your last post was basically a failure to respond, and since you don't wish to continue, i'll assume that you *have* no response.  good day.

"11/12 for me.  Missed the TARP question.  I said less than half.

What's most interesting to me is in the demographic breakdown.  They show by age who got the most correct.  For most, it is unsurprising that the 50+ got the most correct and the 18-29 demographic got the least.

For the Android question, that was reversed.  Also unsurprising.

There was only one other question where that trend was reversed: what's the largest category in the budget?

The breakdown there was 18-29: 45%, 30-49: 41%, 50+: 35%.

On every other question, 50+ got the most right, 30-49 was in the middle and 18-29 got the least correct.

The budget breakdown surprises me.  How is it that 4% of the 18-29 year olds know the inflation rate, but 45% of them know that defense is the largest part of the budget pie?

I'm sure this means something, but I don't know what.  What information source are they using that offers an order of magnitude difference between inflation knowledge and the US budget?

"&gt;The fact remains: first world economies function perfectly fine without slavery. If you want to make the point that slavery is a necessary ""stage"" of economic development, that is quite an astounding assertion. 

What makes you think that a society couldn't function ""better"" for the elite if slavery was still utilized? We chose to abandon slavery, not because we found a more efficient system, but because we deemed slavery immoral, and we were able to supersede the will of those that wished for things to remain the same. Naturally, industry helped in this conversion, but the U.S. still fought a war over it. Slavery isn't so much necessary as it is a product of circumstances and human inclinations. It happened, therefore it can be a very attractive choice for economic development.

I am not suggesting that slavery is the *only* efficient form of labor, only that it provides unparalleled obedience which can yield some truly unique results you won't find in any other system, similar to how enlightened religious-centric societies instilled a certain devotion to one's craft that you don't see in modern art and architecture (which is in general created mostly to be functional and nothing else, though part of it is a cultural thing). Even with the ability to outmatch the output of slave labor with modern technology, something is lost in translation (its not a bad thing, it's just an observation). Slavery was the most popular because it was by far the cheapest, and there was always a surplus of conquered people's to employ in one's labor camps during the periods that it was most popular.

&gt;I'm saying that slavery, like government (ie fractional slavery), is rooted in coercion. Without CHOICE, humans are incapable of making decisions that are rational for them. True order is emergent, not imposed from the top down.

First of all, humans are not always rational creatures. In fact, we are impulsive, and sometimes unpredictable. Why do you think the smart ones invented abstract concepts like governance, religion, and laws, to establish order and control? Second of all, people make both imposed irrational choices and unimposed irrational choices, all the time. Example: overconsumption.

In its most basic form, government is the emergence of natural order in a collective society. Of course it has been perverted in ways that benefit a select few, but this has almost always been the case. Every great tool created by man has been used for selfish, evil devices. The government, like a knife has benevolent uses as well. It has the power to organize and create that which a single individual cannot, like the knife has the ability to cut what you cannot. Civilization as we know it cannot exist without it, and no major civilization has thrived without a stable government.

If you want to go down this route then we must also acknowledge that anything institutional (even society itself) is fractional slavery, including corporations, which are a collective perversion capitalism. To entirely escape coercion, you would need to remove yourself from society. Live alone, isolated in the wilderness, like our hunter-gatherer ancestors. I'm not fond of that lifestyle, so i would rather sacrifice some choice, in order to live with the luxuries of society. I demand a certain spectrum of choices in my life, of course, but I know that I cannot attain absolute freedom without removing myself from civilization.
