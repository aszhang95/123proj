{"body":"\u0026gt;But I don't think they became anti-semites without some help from those who come up with the arguments linking Israel/Judaism.\n\nWhat in the world leads you to that conclusion?\n\n\u0026gt;My broader point is that even if the article is singling out Jews, my point is that it is Zionists themselves who have drawn this equivalence between Israel \u0026amp; Judaism, as you have done above.\n\nI did not do that, the article did. You have confused my objecting to the clearly anti-Semitic article with my bring up something myself. Near as I can tell, in your view people should not attack anti-Semites or defend Israel, because that might lead to more anti-Semites.\n\nYou are simply whining about some unfair charge even when you admit that the charge in this case was fair. I see this preemptive whining more than I see people conflating attacks on Israel with attacks on Jews.\n\nAs for that latter, there is a strong tinge of anti-Semitism that permeates both the Arab violence against Israel and criticism of Israel. In 1900 the whole Middle East was nominally run by the Turks. A small number of Jews start moving, returning even, to \"Palestine\". They did not move in by violence, they were not agents of the British or some other power, they were mostly ideological socialists, trying to escape from Czarist violence. They bought land from the legal Turkish landowners. And the Arabs were pissed and turned to violence. They were pissed in part because \"their\" land was being sold, but it was being sold by the legal owner. (And most of the land being settled was not occupied by anyone, it was the swamps and other abandoned parts of the area). The Arabs were mostly pissed because, while poor and mistreated by the Turks, at least they were Moslems, not dhimmi. That is, they had a long term deeply held religious/cultural view that they were the superior people and that all others (Christians and Jews mostly) were inferior and had to show that they were inferior. This dhimmi status was enforced by both law and custom. But these new immigrants, these new Jews, refused to take that position. They were, to borrow a disparaging term from the U.S., uppity. They protected themselves rather than hiring guards, they made self-sufficient, and later economically successful communities. They refused to play their role. That was intolerable, and combined with the devastating Turkish defeat in WWI lead to large scale Arab violence against the Jews. Remember, before WWI the Jews were legal immigrants, they were not forcing their way in, they were not abusing anyone. The situation has escalated since then, for a large number of reasons, and no side is pure or perfect, but Arab anti-Jewish (anti-non-Muslim if you will) views are at the start and core of the conflict.\n\nAs for current anti-Israel views, anti-Semitism does play a large role. Everyone knows the name of Ariel Sharon, no one knows the name of the Christian leader who ordered the attacks on the refugee camps, nor the name of the Muslim leader who ordered the assassination that lead to that massacre. People talk of how terrible Israel is, but no one speaks of Egypt or Syria. British *journalists* call for a boycott of Israel, a country with a free press, but are silent about China or Zaire. Israel is singled out and it is not because Israel is anything close to the worst country around. In part we hear move about the bad things Israel does because it is a more open society, reporters are safe there and safe to criticize the government.But there is also using a different set of standards for Jews than for others.\n\nSome Americans will say that they justify their criticism of Israel on the money Israel gets from the U.S. government. And on the surface that seems reasonable. But they don't criticize Egypt. They don't criticize Saudi, which gets money from them when they buy gas.  And why all the articles here about how there is this Jew or that Jew in government or in the media? In fact, why the article you defended, which go so much support and defense, which simply listed Jews who are in government. How can you not see the anti-Semitism there?\n\n\n\n(Regarding edit, I did not see the original so that is fine.","score_hidden":false,"archived":true,"name":"t1_c02xax3","author":"matts2","downs":"0","created_utc":"1200608370","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","link_id":"t3_65h1u","parent_id":"t1_c02x98i","score":"0","retrieved_on":"1425823384","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"c02xax3","subreddit":"politics","ups":"0"}

Not proof, evidence.\r\n\r\nTo help your small mind grasp this concept, I'll use an analogy. I'd like you to carefully note, though, that I am not resorting to \"argument from analogy.\" That would be stupid.
