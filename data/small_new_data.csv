["ObamaBi_nla_den","The states rights thing is a way to avoid taking hard positions  This will be kind of lengthy but I think it is a worthwhile illustrationRP advocates 1 trillion in cuts  deeper recession in the short term even according to his own guysDeeper recession  lower tax base Well be generous and say tax revenue only drops by 100 billion with 1 trillion in cutsNext he advocates massive tax cuts for the ultra rich including estate tax capital gains and dividendsThe estate tax brings 400(httpwwwamericanprogressorgissueskfilesb860671html) billion per yearCapital gains tax brings over 100(httpwwwamericancomarchive2009augustcapitalgainstaxanargumentforrepeal) billion per yearAnd the dividend tax brings in 50(httpwwwnytimescom20030521politics21TAXhtml) billion per yearSo thats 650 billion in decreased taxes resulting from a generous reading of the economic impact of his budget cuts plus just a few of the tax cuts he proposesNow were looking at his 1 trillion in cuts decreasing the budget deficit by only 350 billion without even factoring all of the tax cuts into play (it is really closer to no decrease in budget deficit at all just from the tax cuts)Then you consider the fact that he is an Austrian and advocates higher interest on loans Under a hypothetical RP presidency hed start off with about 17 trillion in debt and budgets 250 billion in interest payments on this in his 4 year budget plan This is an effective interest rate of 14 compared to the 7 that new Italy bonds are yielding and they are in little worse shape than usWere running 16 trillion budget deficits per year and would start off an RP presidency with about 17 trillion in debt Lets say the interest paid on that debt is bumped up only 1 per year in his four years and since we know that his tax cuts cancel out most of his budget cuts we can assume the budget deficit will continue at roughly 16 trillion per year if we got his full platformWe start RP presidency with 17 trillion deficitFirst year Start with 17 trillion debt 16 trillion deficit  160 billion in extra interest (24 interest on debt versus current average of 14 means 410 billion in interest payments versus his budgeted 250)Second year Start with 1876 trillion in debt 16 trillion deficit  380 billion in extra interest (34 interest on debt versus current average of 14 means 640 billion in interest payments versus his budgeted 260)Third year Start with 2074 trillion in debt 16 trillion deficit  630 billion in extra interest (44 interest on debt versus current average of 14 means 910 billion in interest payments versus his budgeted 280)Fourth year Start with 2297 trillion in debt 16 trillion deficit  940 billion in extra interest (54 interest on debt versus current average of 14 means 1240 billion in interest payments versus his budgeted 300)End of RP presidency under very generous figures in his favor is total debt of 2551 trillionOK so what  Paul will drastically increase the debt like the rest of themThe advocacy of high interest rates is arguably intentioned for the express purpose of making the debt unsustainable  No politician in America is allowed to advocate sensible positions directly  Look at JFK Rep McDonald Sen Wellstone Rep Giffords etcWhy would you want an unsustainable debt  Bankrupt the federal reserve  How do you get away with shadow advocacy of bankrupting the federal reserve  Propose a gold standard since the oligarchs possess almost all of the gold now  The gold standard will actually be better for the oligarchs than the current systemThe problem is how is he suppose to extract himself from a roundabout maneuver towards an end goal into something that actually works for America without dying if he genuinely wants to help  That is the sort of thing that gets you shot as a politicianSo back to the original point states rights  You are not allowed to talk sense on hard issues  So politicians deflect  States rights is one of the big ways Paul does itYou might also be interested in how we got into this mess  Brief history of AmericaIt is important to know that there were competing factions from the inception of America These roughly divided into the Federalist and DemocraticRepublicans factions In short the Federalists supported the American revolution and the DemocraticRepublicans were British loyalistsThe DemocraticRepublicans maintained a highly insular nominating process and never had much popular support The history books explain their rise to power through the Whiskey Rebellion but this isnt really true George Washington used force to put down the Whiskey Rebellion and while most people are taught this was deeply unpopular no one will try to tell you that he couldnt have won a third term in a landslideAfter two federalist presidents the DemocraticRepublicans took the White House in 1800 Eleven short years later opposition had grown so intense that the original 13th amendment was passed in early 1812 which banned people from federal office who held titles of nobility This was done because widespread British subversion was recognized The War of 1812 followed shortly thereafter They teach you America won the war at school but this is a lieThe DemocraticRepublicans (British subversives) maintained control after the War of 1812 up until President Jackson He was a war hero (and federalist) who successfully challenged the nominating process of the DemocraticRepublicans and took office in 1828 This is the first President to suffer assassination attempts one of which was done by a man who thought he was the rightful king of England (he was being manipulated by subversive agents)Jackson wasnt killed but in 1828 the whole country still knew that the British were still actively subverting the infant nation This is when the divisions over slavery kicked into high gear to drive the nation into Civil War since the British were having trouble maintaining soft dominance in the aftermath of the War of 1812The south was openly supported by the British government while the north was financed by the Rothschilds These are two sides of the same coin The Rothschild family cemented their position as the dominant world financiers as part of the War of 1812 drama If you dont know the British were fighting Napoleon at the same time Rothchild agents initiated selling of British assets right after the Battle of Waterloo was conclusively decided making most market participants think Napoleon had won but then buying up all assets at firesale prices after the crash This

efforts to dominate continental Europe are fully underway at this point led by Edward VII often considered the greatest strategist of the nobility since William the Conqueror 800 years earlierIn short order you get World War 1 the Federal Reserve prohibition to cement the oil cartel (ethanol was being used as an alternative and you could shut down its production by saying the equipment was for

["aletoledo","gtgt Public bodies may impose reasonable time place and manner restrictions on speakers Restrictions must be narrowly tailored to affect a compelling state interest and may not be content based Ariz Atty Gen Op I99006gt She was speaking during a call to the public the board clearly claims that the content of her comments was not in line with their agenda Well if their agenda didnt match up with what she was speaking of and you heard them say this in the video then its even simpler than you suggest This was not therefore an open forum to discuss whatever she wanted but instead was supposed to be addressing what was on their agenda I couldnt hear what was the topic of the agenda but lets say it was a new traffic light on some street corner and she gets up talking about what she did then I think any reasonable person should recognize that is against their agenda and therefore she should be shut down Their agenda at that moment was a street light and shes distracting them from thatgtgt A government that represents the people can hold a democratic vote at any time and change nearly every rule especially the rules governing meeting proceduresgt Maybe in fantasy land this is true but here in the real world governing bodies in a democracy (or more correctly a republic) often are quite restricted on whenhowwhy they can make lawsRead above where you posted the state law regarding public bodies being able to set their own procedures These procedures are set by the public body holding a vote Youre trying to expand this to making laws to encompass your argument but its much simpler than that This is a simple procedure where you admitted above was against their meetings agenda so they held a procedural vote and disallowed this woman from deviating them from the stated agenda of the meeting No law was being made it was something in their right to set procedures for the public body meetingsgtgt One crazy person can not impede the will of the majoritygt Uh huh and what does this have to do with our discussion Crazy people ARE however allowed to speak during calls to the public as long as they follow the rulesAs you said above the topic she was discussing was not on the agenda of this meeting so she was out of order to be adding new agenda items to the meeting Im sure if she followed procedures she could petition the council in the correct fashion and be heard but you cant let crazy people to speak whatever is on their mind if its against the public bodies agendagtgt She is not part of the government bodygt No you idiot but the council she was speaking to is and as I said  most governing bodies (like the council NOT THE LADY) must wait for the time of the current speaker to expireNow we get to the point in this discussion where you start to use insults over logic to reinforce your point You know youve lost this discussion so insults are all you have left Not sure if there is much point in continuing but hopefully youre learning something here so Ill finish up this post and then move on to someone more civilYou made the point that public bodies have procedures where a speaker must yield the floor before the public body can continue its meeting What you conflated here though is the internal procedures of a public body (ie council member to council member) and external procedures (ie council member to represented citizen) A council member doesnt have to yield to a citizen if that citizen is out of order If that was the case then countless government meetings could be delayed by extremist groups that wish to push their own private agendas over that of the publics agenda For example PETA could goto a governmental meeting get ahold of the podium and then never yield it sitting there twiddling their thumbs and paralyzing the meeting The government therefore has to have the ability to cease such nonsense and get on with the stated agenda of the meetinggt She clearly did nothing egregious and its a moot point regardless because she was being silenced before this was an issue (before she turned around)You said above that she appeared to know her rights and was familiar with the local city council so there is a good chance she has been before this particular city council before and they were familiar with her tactics Theyve likely had to deal with her in the past and that is why they were able to democratically vote to censor her and have the police remove her so quickly Did she do something egregious That is a subjective opinion To you and I it doesnt seem very bad As an aside if I showed you a 5 second video of a man saying hi to a little girl on the street it might not be egregious either However if I explained that this man was a child molester then you might consider his approach to a little girl on the street as egregious This is why its subjectiveSo was her actions egregious Yes Why Because a democratic vote was held by the representatives of the public and it was determined through this vote that she was acting outside the procedural bounds I think this is an important point that youre ignoring These are public representatives duly elected and serving under the good will of the public If they were not good representatives then they would not have been elected andor they would be impeached This is how a representative democracy worksgt You cant just vote on anything and make it law  honestly thats insane Right now some states are suing to call the healthcare bill unconstitutional  what happened to vote it in and its the will of the peopleYour point here is ambivalent I believe On one hand youre saying that its insane that Obama et al would create a healthcare law when they clearly had no authority to do so On the other hand you seem to be arguing that there is some form of preceding law that is not insane Which is it then Is there a special dance that legislators have to do to make some votes effective and if they forget to do this then their democratic vote is nullifiedI think youre making the idea of laws too complicated A law is basically a set of agreed upon procedures The majority agrees to abide by these rules and therefore it becomes a law gt You poor naive fool Youve cemented your position as one of the ignorant reddit users you mentioned early in your long winded but lacking in quality post If you cant see the lunacy in those last few sentences then I doubt there is much I can do to educate you Good luck sirI think I will end this discussion with a critique of you I try never to direct anything towards the speaker but in this case I think you represent a broader attitude of people on reddit so dont take this too personally because many people do it other than youFirst you think by insulting me and calling me a fool helps your argument This is selfevidently weak The part that irks me though is when you say good luck sir youre trying to pretend that youre being polite I dont know if you truly believe youre somehow acting in a polite fashion youre knowingly trolling with this or a bit of both It isnt the case though and Im calling you out on this now Youre a rude person and have directly insulted me at least twice in your comment Trying to add a final flourish of politeness to your comment doesnt alleviate you of this guilt youre still a crude person trying to pretend to be something youre not (ie civilized and cultured)Im sure this is hard for you to recognize in yourself because a frog doesnt look ugly to himself so you cant see anything wrong with how you act Honestly though youre deteriorating society and this board by such crude behavior You can go on behaving this way its your right but I have now made you aware of this behavior so dont deceive yourself Youre making

mouth and added a connection between things Ive written  my view of you putting words in my mouth That is not what I said and that is not how I see it You put words in my mouth by adding words to skew what I said to fit your conception of what I saidYou tenuous grasp of the English language is not exactly helping you sell this imaginary air of academia Did you run this gibberish through Babelfish five or six times before posting itgtMy entire argument was laced with my confession that I did not condone the Iraq war but that I condoned the removal of Saddam Which again is so simplistic and puerile that it boggles the mind You cannot examine one tiny facet of the overall end result in a vaccuum you nitwit You cant pick one tiny sliver of a marginally decent outcome (ohh boy a dictator has been replaced with lawless anarchy and sectarian violence hooray) out of an enormous pile of unmitigated disaster and say see everything worked out greatgtFirst of all you have never met me so do

who keeps baselessly sobbing about words being put into his mouth when I provide direct quotes from his own posts I find it more than a little funny that youre trying to hamfistedly distort my position to this degree No one has ever debated whether or not Saddam was a war criminal you ignorant muppet The debate has been about whether or not the United States should be meting out the justice (and good Lord do you ever have the worldview of a naive child) you keep blathering about It is painfully obvious that we should not given that Iraq is in worse shape now than it was even during our years of sanctions The Iraqi people did not ask for our assistance which was not the purpose of our invasion in the first place But you cant accept this concept because it flies in the face of your childish fantasies about being the good guysgtYes I am familiar with the history of Saddam HussienEvidently you are not or youd be aware where the weapons he was using on his own people came from You are apparently equally ignorant of the history of the mujahideen in Afghanistan and who armed THEM Id suggest doing some research before your next imaginary class lest you embarrass yourself in front of imaginary studentsgtAnd Ive noticed you dodged the one question I was hoping you would respond to could you go face to face with a former child soldier and tell them that the best thing for them amp there people would be to fight off a genocide by themselvesMore appeals to blind emotion But but but but but think of the CHILDREN we have to save them via killing some 100000 civilians (including children) in an unprovoked war against their elected government Grow upgtThe US was unable to prove that Iraq had WMDs however no one can prove that Iraq wouldnt have used a WMD on the US in the future so this whole argument is COMPLETELY circularThis is by a wide margin the most childish thing anyone has ever said on the internet Congratulations Ok we said we were invading because of WMDs and it turned out there werent any but you cant prove its impossible that in a hypothetical future they MIGHT have gotten some and used them against so the invasion was totally justified and really

that I know nothing about international politics because I try to see things from other peoples point of view and encourage you to do the same thing is just flat out ridiculous kiddoHAW Im hard pressed to decide what the most pathetic part of this paragraph is Is it1 The transparent appeal to nonexistant authority Lots of other people agree with me2 The way youre still clinging to this I am an authority in this field I know nothing about honest pretense3 The fact that you actually believe that a real educator would do something this incredibly sad and didnt think it would strain the

place to try and diminish the argument you cant counter in any other waySo much stupidity to choose from This is a hard onegt And again I never said personal anecdotes trump empirical evidence I shared with you valuable insight because thats all you can do with international politics is go over data and derive your own sense of insight then share that with othersOh wait this is the saddest

["slapchopsuey","The level of moderation necessary is tied to the size of a subreddit (as laid out above herd problems) The better rpolitics you remember is largely the memory of a smaller rpolitics where less moderation was necessary While the name of the subreddit remains the same with growth it is a fundamentally different place Not just larger the dynamics at work are different as it grows The largest subreddits have the continual problem of pushing the uppermost size boundary on reddit and the trial amp error is done there making for less rocky growth for the following tier of subreddits As for the admins new mod tools the dialogue between mods and admins is continual and we keep hearing theyre working on it and most recently that theyre almost ready So the sooner the tool set can more closely address the problems on the huge reddit of 2012 (instead of the smaller reddit of 200x) the better Also garyp714 did an accurate assessment elsewhere in this thread of a significant part of what exactly went wrong in the past year that increased moderation was required  Part of the abovementioned growth was the influx of the internets Ron Paul crowd last summer which was a mess Wherever they go they leave a framework of rules and regulations in their wake making life for everyone a little more difficult because they insist upon their liberty to take a shit in the commons (as garyp714 explained) Other problems from growth that had to be addressed around the same time were similar to those facing other default subs the overflow of imgur links lol pics etc Editorialized titles where people were putting their comments on stories in the title box got so bad it was a crapshoot to guess what was inside any given link All the above are problems that come with growth and all require moderation to solve As growth continues more problems will arise that require still more moderation The primary driver of moderation is growth The rate of growth is increasing also IIRC shortly after New Years it hit one million subscribers and before winter is done it will grow by another 15 of a million Less than one season to grow 15 million and the previous 15 million took one and a half seasons Being on the front edge of growth rpolitics is one of several testing grounds for solving the problems growth presents Some solutions work pretty well right away some problems take a few tries to solve As the subreddit continues to grow at a rapid pace there isnt long between when problems are solved and when new problems force us to solve themFurther it really is peculiar that you claim that rpolitics is destroyed yet youre still here You dont have to be here what you choose to do with your free time is up to you The sidebar is filled with many good amp active related political subreddits and if no other political subreddit is to your liking youre welcome to start one With all the plugs you make for your subreddit its clear you understand grassroots wordofmouth marketing so if you think you have the formula for a successful subreddit go for it Youre not the first one though there has been a regular pattern of replacement subreddits for rpolitics that keep sprouting up In each one the creator set forth to do right what they saw rpolitics mods as doing wrong One of these days Ill make a section of them to link in the sidebar Continuing on your recurring theme of rpolitics was literally perfect until the terrible mods destroyed it with their moderation thought at the root of this seems a resistance to change While its natural to hesitate at the prospect of change time (and all the changes it brings) marches forward Digging in the heels is futile Things change with time and growth The old days when redditcom was the entry level of reddit with rpolitics just a subreddit of a mere tens of thousands or a few hundred thousand are over Now redditcom is gone and the set of truly gigantic defaults is the entry level of reddit rpolitics isnt a destination room anymore its a lobby The destination rooms are in the sidebar The reddit of 200x is gone just as 200x is gone Theres no going back other than in memories Unless you want to do a reenactment of the past but itll only be a reenactment as were no longer people of 200x anymore we can no sooner erase the experiences and aging that changed us from who we were then to who we are now than we can erase the past few years Time and change are constants in life Let the perfectly fine rpolitics of yesteryear be a memory that forever warms your heart because its gone and it cant come back The Spanish Hapsburg Charles II couldnt handle the losses that come with time and change and fought against his moderators ultimately getting his wish to exhume his parents and
